# Project_Nike

This is my first HTML and CSS web page project. I recently rediscovered it on my hard drive and made some updates to its code. One significant improvement I made was separating the header and footer, which were being repeated across different pages. This change made the code cleaner and more maintainable.

I also added a new map feature to the Contact Us page and enhanced the designs of the Contact Us and About Us pages to make them more eye-catching and interactive.

## Local Development

Since I was using local files, the fetch method wasn't working when I opened the HTML files directly in my browser. This method typically works when the HTML files are served through a web server that supports JavaScript. To see the end result of the project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your HTML files are located.

3. Install the `http-server` package globally using npm (Node Package Manager):

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server

This will serve your HTML files locally, allowing you to access them through a web browser. You can then interact with your web pages and see the changes you've made.

Feel free to explore my project, and if you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!

Happy coding!
